                <p>This is a tiny project I've been working on to learn more about web dev. 
                    So what better way to learn it by making a simple guessing game! üòé</p>
                <p>The game involves you guessing what you think the Pok√©mon is from its silhouette/image.</p>
                <p>You can see which Pok√©mon you have guessed by viewing your Pok√©dex.</p>

                    <li>Eventually the Pok√©mon will be revealed</li>
